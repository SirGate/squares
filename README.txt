      There is twelve squares, with random numbers from 0 to 9 in the corners.
Squares formed next figure (see picture №1 pdf file). Need to change positions of the squares 
in that way,so sums of four connected corners should be 10(in pdf file filled
 by green color),and sums of two and three conneceted corners should be no more 
 then 10(in pdf file filled by yellow color).
     On the input - text file , one string of which contains four numbers - 
values of corners of one square. 
The order of strings and numbers in the strings is next:(see picture №3 of  pdf file).
For example input file  has next view:

1 0 7 5 
3 4 1 3 
5 1 1 4
7 6 1 8
5 7 4 4 
8 3 3 4 
7 1 5 4 
4 1 1 0 
3 1 1 4 
2 4 3 8 
5 1 1 7 
4 2 4 2 

The final result of permutation  output in console in the same format as input.
If there are possible some decisions  then will output  
all decisions divided by empty string.
